        :param lazy: If True, the raw data is stored in the instance and fields are not initialized immediately.
            Using Dataclass as fields themselves can be expensive especially during initialization (Loading data).
            This option allows for lazy loading of the data into the fields of the Dataclass only when accessed.
            This reduces the time taken to load data into the Dataclass instance. However, caveats include:
            - Raw data is stored in the instance, which may increase memory usage.
            - Validation of the data is not done until the data is accessed. Hence, errors will only be raised on attribute access.
            - In the advent that the lazy Dataclass has nested non-lazy Dataclass fields, the nested fields will be
                remaining uninitialized until accessed, meaning full data loading for such fields will be done on access,
                which may be expensive.
            - Lazy loading is not recommended for multi-level nested Dataclasses, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

            On the other hand, if False, the raw data is loaded into the fields immediately during initialization.
            Validation of the data is done immediately, and errors are raised if the data does not meet the field requirements.
            Of course, this is at the expense of time (may be slower).
