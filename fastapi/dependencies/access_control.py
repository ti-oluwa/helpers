    Connection access control dependency factory.

    Returns a dependency that checks if the http connection is allowed to access to the resource
    based on the provided `access_info` and the `access_checker` function.

    Usage Example:
    ```python
    from fastapi.security.api_key import APIKeyHeader
    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession

    def check_api_key(api_key: str, session: AsyncSession) -> bool:
        # Check if the api_key is valid
        return True

    async def check_access(
        api_key: typing.Optional[str],
        session: typing.Optional[AsyncSession]
    ) -> bool:
        if not api_key:
            return False
        return check_api_key(api_key, session)

    client_api_key = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-KEY", auto_error=False)
    # Use auto_error=False to prevent default HTTPException from being raised
    # when the header is not provided. This allows the dependency to return None
    # instead of raising an exception. and then enables the access control dependency
    # to raise the proper http exception (regular http exception or websocket disconnect)
    # when the access is denied. This allows the access control dependeny to be used
    # with websocket connections as well.
    authorized_api_client_only = access_control(client_api_key, check_access, message="Unauthorized API client!")

    # In a route
    @app.get("/api/protected")
    async def protected_route(
        connection: HTTPConnection = Depends(authorized_api_client_only)
    ):
        return {"message": "You are authorized!"}
    ```
    In the example above, the `authorized_api_client_only` dependency checks if the connection
    is made by an authorized API client by checking the `X-API-KEY` header in the connection.
    If the header is not provided, the dependency returns `None` instead of raising an exception.
    The access control dependency then raises the proper http exception (regular http exception or websocket disconnect)
    when the access is denied.

    :param access_info: A resolveable type, callable or dependency that returns
        the necessary information (about a client) to be used to check access, by the `access_checker` function.
        This can be an `HTTPConnection` type, a `SecurityBase` instance, a `Security` or `Depends` dependency,
        a regular callable or a type that can be resolved by fastapi's dependency injection system (`fastapi.Depends`).
    :param access_checker: A callable that takes the connection object and returns a boolean
        indicating if it is allowed access or not.

    :param status_code: The status code to return if the connection is disallowed access.
        Default is `HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN`.

    :param message: The message to return if the connection is disallowed access.

    :param raise_access_denied: A callable that raises an exception with the provided status code and message.
        If not provided or falsy, no exception is raised and the connection is returned by the dependency.

        Setting this to falsy value can be useful when you want changes made to be made to the connection object
        by the access checker to remain if the connection is allowed, but not if it is denied,
        without raising an exception. There by allowing the connection to be served, with or without the required access.

    :param return_handler: A callable that takes the connection object and returns a result - the modified connection object or another object.
        If provided, the dependency returns the result of the handler instead of the connection object.

    :return: A dependency that checks if the connection is allowed access to the resource.
